# Github Custom Automation Script 

This project was created using Python to help automate the tedious process of creating a local and Github repository.

By running this script, any user can simultaneously create a Github repository, a new local folder for their project containing a README.md, an initial commit, stage, and push online into their newly created repository, as well as, open visual studio code to continue working.

prerequisites:
1. PyGitHub - Do not worry, this script will download this package for you if it is not currently installed
2. Visual Studio Code - but I mean... who doesn't already have this though, amirite?
